# KanjiDamage Jisho
## What is it?

Yet another japanese dictionary app for Android.

Based on a [KanjiDamage](http://www.kanjidamage.com) data. 
Please check out the website first! All credits go to its author Steven Schultz.

So this app is an offline copy of the website. Handy enough to enjoy mnemonics, or look up useful vocabulary.

## What it's not?

It is NOT a full-blown dictionary! I highly recommend [Takoboto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.takoboto&hl=en) if you need one.

It is NOT a learning method app. No quizzes, no animations, no shit. Just a dictionary to have an offline copy of KanjiDamage.

It is NOT official app. It's not even published on Google Play or F-Droid just in case.

## How to install?

Download [.apk](https://github.com/jhspetersson/KanjiDamageApp/releases/download/2019-05-05/KanjiDamage.apk) and open on your Android device. 
Confirm installation from unknown source.

## Features

* search by kanji, jukugo, or onyomi
* open kanji/jukugo in [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/), [Kanji Study](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy&hl=en), or [Takoboto](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.takoboto&hl=en)
* select text from Chrome or another app and search it with this one
